I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer** driven by a deep passion for solving complex problems with **AI**. With a robust academic foundation in **Computer Science and Engineering**, I specialize in creating cutting-edge solutions in **Generative AI**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. My goal is to take AI to new heights—pushing boundaries and building scalable, high-performance systems that truly make an impact.

## 💻 What I Do

I currently work at **[Nodes Digital Limited](https://nodesdigitalbd.com)**, where I design, develop, and deploy state-of-the-art AI systems. Here’s how I contribute:

- **AI Development**: I build and deploy **machine learning models** using **Streamlit**, **FastAPI**, **Docker**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch**, ensuring they work seamlessly in real-world production environments.
- **Generative AI**: I craft powerful **chatbots** and **LLM-based solutions** that understand and generate human-like responses. Tools like **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Ollama** are at the core of my work, making AI interactions smarter and more intuitive.
- **End-to-End Deployment**: From model development to deployment, I handle everything—from packaging models in Docker containers to ensuring smooth integration with APIs, providing flexible and efficient solutions.

## 🌐 Explore My Work

I also run **[MLHub.Space](https://mlhub.space)**, my personal server, where you can explore my:

- **Custom AI Solutions**: Built with **LangChain** and **Ollama**, my chatbots and apps are built to solve real-world problems with NLP and **Generative AI**.
- **Innovative Integrations**: From **Agentic AI** to **LLMs**, I integrate cutting-edge tools that empower teams to harness the true potential of AI.
- **Check out my experience and project sections** to get an in-depth understanding of my hands-on work and how I can bring value to your team.

## 🌱 Why Choose Me?

I’m not just passionate about AI—I’m committed to innovating and delivering results. My deep expertise in **Machine Learning**, **Generative AI**, **Python**, and **API Integration** enables me to build scalable solutions that transform businesses. Here’s what sets me apart:

- **Hands-on Experience**: I have built complex, real-world applications and deployed them at scale.
- **AI Mindset**: I’m always at the forefront of new developments in **LLMs**, **chatbot development**, and **API integration**, striving to make smarter, more efficient systems.
- **Collaboration**: I believe in the power of **teamwork**—whether it’s mentoring others or working with cross-functional teams, I foster collaboration and growth.

## 🚀 Let's Build the Future of AI Together!

I’m eager to bring my expertise in AI and machine learning to your team, solve tough challenges, and drive innovation. **Let’s create something extraordinary.**
