In our startup, which operates in the agriculture sector, we frequently need to analyze a large number of research papers to stay updated with the latest advancements and make informed decisions. However, this process can be extremely time-consuming and challenging. To streamline this, we developed an in-house **Research Bot** that significantly enhances our efficiency.

The bot works by allowing us to upload PDF research papers into the system. These papers are then processed and analyzed by our custom-built **Large Language Model (LLM)**. This model is designed to understand and extract key information from the documents. Instead of manually reading through hundreds of pages, we can now simply interact with the bot by asking questions relevant to our research. The bot intelligently responds with summaries, insights, or direct answers from the uploaded papers.

This solution enables us to extract critical findings quickly, saving valuable time and effort. As a result, we can focus more on applying insights to real-world problems and innovation, rather than getting bogged down in the laborious task of reading through multiple research papers. It's a powerful tool for accelerating our work and making our research process more agile and efficient.
