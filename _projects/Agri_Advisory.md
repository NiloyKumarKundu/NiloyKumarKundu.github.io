This project is a cutting-edge, multilingual AI-driven platform designed to assist farmers and agriculture enthusiasts by providing timely and relevant agricultural advice. The system enables users to ask questions related to farming practices, crop management, pest control, weather forecasts, and more, in either Bangla or English, through both text and audio inputs.

At the core of the system is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which combines information retrieval with language generation. The platform utilizes a vector database to retrieve the most relevant agricultural knowledge from a vast collection of resources. When a user submits a query, the system first retrieves the most pertinent information from the database and then feeds it into a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a contextually accurate, human-like response.

To enhance user experience, the system offers responses in both text and speech formats. The speech synthesis allows users to listen to the answers, making the platform accessible even to those with limited literacy or those working in the fields.

### Key Features:
* **Multilingual Support**: Allows interactions in both Bangla and English.
* **Text and Audio Input**: Users can ask questions via text or voice.
* **Vector Database Integration**: Retrieves highly relevant information based on the query.
* **LLM-Based Response Generation**: Generates accurate, context-aware responses.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Provides spoken answers for better accessibility.

This platform aims to revolutionize agricultural support by providing a user-friendly, intelligent assistant that delivers practical advice in real-time, helping users make informed decisions and improve farming outcomes.
