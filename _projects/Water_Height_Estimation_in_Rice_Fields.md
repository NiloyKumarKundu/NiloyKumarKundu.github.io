This project focuses on automating the measurement of water height in rice fields to enhance irrigation management. Using computer vision techniques, we processed images of rice fields to detect and measure the water levels. The system combines image analysis with regression models to estimate water height accurately. The solution provides real-time data, enabling more efficient water usage and better irrigation planning. This innovation helps optimize resource allocation, improves crop management, and supports sustainable agricultural practices by reducing water wastage.
