Why RNN?
In NLP, using BOW, TF-IDF, Word2vec they actually converts text data into vectors. After that we give this vector to our machine lerning models.

Understand very important thing from this text preproccessing technique, the sequence informationn is discarded. While converting the text data, the sequence is discarded. For that reason, the accuracy is very poor.

But it is very important and RNN is very helpful to deal with such kind of data and maintain sequence information.


Applications:
- Google translator
- Goole Image search
- Time series data
